* Hammond 2022: [Ghidra for Reverse Engineering (PicoCTF 2022 #42 'bbbloat')](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oTD_ki86c9I). In this video, John Hammond demonstrates how to solve a "reverse engineering" challenge from PicoCTF 2022. Here is a brief summary of the steps he takes:
    * He starts by running the program, which asks for a "favorite number." Since he doesn't know the answer, the program exits.
    * He tries several *basic tools* first like `ltrace`, `strace`, `gdb`, etc. to seek some *low hanging fruits*, but they don't provide the answer.
    * He then opens the file in Ghidra&mdash;a popular reverse engineering tool. By searching for the text "favorite number" in *defined strings*, he traces the exact place in the code where the check happens.
    * Inside the code, he discovers the hexadecimal value `0x86187` (i.e. `549255` in decimal) which is used to reveal the *flag* of the challenge&mdash;`picoCTF{...}`.

* Optional: € Eagle and Nancy 2020: [The Ghidra Book: 2. Reversing And Disassembly Tools](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/the-ghidra-book/9781098125684/xhtml/ch02.xhtml#ch02lev29). Look, I’d love to dive into *The Ghidra Book* and give you the summary of Chapter 2, but there’s a slight technical difficulty&mdash;my wallet is currently screaming *"Not enough minerals!"* I tried typing `show me the money` with my keyboard about fifty times, but apparently, it does not work. No 10,000 gas, no 10,000 minerals, and definitely no "free" access to O'Reilly's library for me either. Just hit `F10, E, Q` then.
